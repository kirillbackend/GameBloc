# GameBloc
Recently, games have stopped bringing me pleasure, as well as programming has begun to slide into a routine and an endless stream of what needs to be learned. To consolidate skills, you need a pet project on which you can train. The main criteria of the project was the use of the following technologies:

- ASP .Net Core
- C#
- Entity Framework

All these conditions were reinforced by the fact that I can't get the job I dream of and the breakup of the relationship. I want to go through it all, and as my own experience shows, when you're busy with something, it's easier for you to go through it all. That's why I'm starting this pet project.
